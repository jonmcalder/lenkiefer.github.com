## A datavize remix

I came across some [interesting analysis](https://oregoneconomicanalysis.com/2016/06/08/the-housing-trilemma/) from Josh Lehner at the [Oregon Office of Economic Analysis](https://oregoneconomicanalysis.com/) about the "Housing Trilemma".

The Housing Trilemma, captured in the chart below is based on the following claim:

> Every city wants to have a strong local economy, high quality of life and housing affordability for its residents. Unfortunately these three dimensions represent the Housing Trilemma. A city can achieve success on two but not all three at the same time. Underlying all of these tradeoffs are local policies as well.
